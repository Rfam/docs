* Using "entry":

  You can also refer to a family by ``entry``, although this is a convenience
  that should be used only if you're not sure if what you have is an accession or an ID.

  * `http://rfam.org/family?entry=RF00360 <http://rfam.org/family?entry=RF00360>`_ or
  * `http://rfam.org/family?entry=snoZ107_R87 <http://rfam.org/family?entry=snoZ107_R87>`_
