How to link to Rfam?
====================

You can refer to Rfam families either by accession or ID. You can also refer to a family by "entry", although this is a convenience that should be used only if you're not sure if what you have is an accession or an ID.

Rfam accession numbers are more stable between releases than IDs and we **strongly** recommend that you link by accession number.

Here are some examples of linking to Rfam:

* Directly, using either accession or ID:
  
  `http://rfam.xfam.org/family/RF00360 <http://rfam.xfam.org/family/RF00360>`_ or
  
  `http://rfam.xfam.org/family/snoZ107_R87 <http://rfam.xfam.org/family/snoZ107_R87>`_

* By accession: 

  `http://rfam.xfam.org/family?acc=RF00360 <http://rfam.xfam.org/family?acc=RF00360>`_

* By ID: 

  `http://rfam.xfam.org/family?id=snoZ107_R87 <http://rfam.xfam.org/family?id=snoZ107_R87>`_

* Using "entry":

  `http://rfam.xfam.org/family?entry=RF00360 <http://rfam.xfam.org/family?entry=RF00360>`_ or
  
  `http://rfam.xfam.org/family?entry=snoZ107_R87 <http://rfam.xfam.org/family?entry=snoZ107_R87>`_
